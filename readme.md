## note

We're waiting for a [patch on hyperx](https://github.com/substack/hyperx/pull/24). Need to update deps after this is fixed.

## TODO

* Optimize images before uploading to moltin -- compress, upload multiple sizes
* concat and inline css
* inline moltin client
* show 404 for categories that don't exist
* check out service worker for pre-fetching shop products
